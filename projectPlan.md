# Project Plan – OneRepMax (1RM) 


## Create the Website 

**Set up the project structure** 

- [x] Create a new directory for the project 

- [x] Initialize a Git repository 

- [x] Set up a basic HTML template 

**Choose a web framework** 

- [x] React 

**Set up the development environment** 

- [x] Install necessary dependencies 

- [x] Configure build tools 

**Design the website layout** 

- [x] Create wireframes or mockups 

- [x] Implement the layout using HTML and CSS 

## Automate Calculations Using a Form 

- [x] Identify the calculations needed from Alex's graphs 

- [ ] Create a form on the website to collect user input 

- [ ] Design the form layout 

- [ ] Implement form validation 

- [ ] Write JavaScript functions to perform the calculations 

- [ ] Connect the form to the calculation functions 

- [ ] Capture form input 

- [ ] Display the results on the website 

- [ ] Test the form and calculations to ensure accuracy 

## Add form demonstration gifs from external API 

- [x] Choose API ([https://exercisedb.dev/api/v1/exercises]) 

- [x] Fetch data from API 

- [x] Parse and extract relevant gif URLs from the API response 

- [x] Integrate gifs into the form UI 

- [x] Display gifs based on user input or form selections 

- [x] Handle loading and error states for API requests 

- [ ] Test gif display functionality across devices and browsers 

 

## Final Steps 

1. Test the entire website for functionality and usability 

2. Deploy the website to a hosting service 

3. Monitor and maintain the website 
 

## Completed Tasks 

- [x] Create the Website 

- [x] Incorporate Table from Alex's Excel Sheets 

- [ ] Automate Calculations Using a Form 

- [x] Use external API to display demonstrations 

- [ ] Final Steps 

 

# Requirements 

**Mandatory: 3 features** 

### Section I 

- [x] Analyze data stored in arrays, objects, sets, or maps and display information about it in your app. 

- [ ] Use a regular expression to validate user input and either prevent the invalid input or inform the user about it (in all cases prevent invalid input from being stored or saved). 

- [x] Create a function that accepts two or more input parameters and returns a value that is calculated or determined by the inputs. Basic math functions don’t count (e.g., addition, etc). 

- [ ] Visualize data in a user-friendly way (e.g., graph, chart, etc). This can include using libraries like Chart.js. 

- [ ] Convert user input between two formats and display the result (e.g., Fahrenheit to Celsius, kilograms to pounds, etc). 

- [ ] Calculate and display data based on an external factor (e.g., get the current date, and display how many days remain until some event). 

- [x] Persist data to an internal API and make the stored data accessible in your app (including after reload/refresh). This can be achieved either by using local storage or building your own API that stores data into a JSON file. 

 

### Section II (Can swap with items from Section I) 

- [x] Create a Node.js web server using a modern framework such as Express.js. 

- [ ] Interact with a SQLite database to store and retrieve information. 

- [ ] Implement modern interactive UI features (e.g., table/data sorting, autocomplete, drag-and-drop, calendar date picker, etc). 

- [x] Develop your project using a common JavaScript framework such as React, Svelte, or Vue. 

- [ ] Create 3 or more unit tests for your application (and document how to run them). 

 

## Testing 

- Identification of potential issues or bugs 

- Verification of functionality and performance 

- Ensuring compatibility across different devices and platforms 

- Evaluation of user experience and interface usability 

- Confirmation of security measures and data integrity 

- Validation of adherence to project requirements and specifications 

- Gathering feedback for improvement and refinement
